<h1 align="center"> ~ JavaScript 100 Project ~ <h1>

<p align="center">This project was made to practice my JavaScript skills
as well as to give me a body of work to show to potential employers. Below you will find 
a table of contents with each project that I have done currently, each project will have skills I learned outlined
as well as other things I learned during that project.

All of these projects were from either the <a href="https://jsbeginners.com/">jsbeginners</a> website, or the <a href="https://javascript30.com/"> JavaScript30 </a> website, 
though I did not use any of their code JavaScript, I did use files such as images, audio, or html boilerplate when necessary.

## Background Color Changer <a name="bgColorChanger"></a>

This challenge was fairly straight forward. I simply had to make a function to change the background color
by grabbing the body and changing it's background color with a random input from an array of colors I made.
