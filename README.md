<h1 align="center"> ~ JavaScript 100 Project ~ <h1>

<p align="center">This project was made to practice my JavaScript skills
as well as to give me a body of work to show to potential employers. Below you will find 
a table of contents with each project that I have done currently, each project will have skills I learned outlined
as well as other things I learned during that project.

<p> 
All of these projects were from the <a href="https://jsbeginners.com/">jsbeginners</a> website,
though I did not use any of their code or files, everything was created by myself. I just took 
the ideas for the challenges.

## Background Color Changer <a name="bgColorChanger"></a>

This challenge was fairly straight forward. I simply had to make a function to change the background color
by grabbing the body and changing it's background color with a random input from an array of colors I made.
